	Abstract = {A general variational technique for calculating the electrostatic free energy of a system of interacting double layers is presented. A stationarity principle for a large class of electrical potential- and position-dependent ion distribution functions and boundary conditions is derived and shown to be unique. The functional satisfying this principle for an open system is identified with the corresponding grand canonical excess surface free energy ?. The special case of a functional quadratic in the potential ( the Debye?H?ckel approximation for the ion distributions together with generalized linear boundary conditions) is shown to permit reduction of the free energy calculation to the evaluation of surface integrals. Illustrations of the approach are presented in the Debye?H?ckel approximation for two interacting planar double layers and in the non-linear Poisson?Boltzmann approximation for an isolated planar interface under both constant surface charge density and constant surface potential conditions.The variational approach is straightforward to implement for a variety of double-layer geometries and surface charge conditions. Moreover, it directly and unambiguously identifies the appropriate electrostatic free energy. We believe the variational technique to be powerful and versatile method for calculating interactions between colloidal particles.},

At the Gaussian level we recover the classical {Debye-H\"{u}ckel} ({DH}) theory, which is found to exhibit the full hierarchy of multibody correlations determined by pair-distribution functions given by the screened {DH} potential. Higher-order corrections can lead to attractive pair interactions between similarly charged particles in asymmetric ionic environments. The phase diagram for an ionic fluid shows a critical point of demixing. The critical temperature and critical density exhibit pronounced deviations from {DH} theory for highly asymmetric ionic systems.},

   abstract = {We formulate the exact non-linear field theory for a fluctuating counter-ion distribution in the presence of a fixed, arbitrary charge distribution. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is obtained as the saddle-point of the field-theoretic action, and the effects of counter-ion fluctuations are included by a loop-wise expansion around this saddle point. The Poisson equation is obeyed at each order in this loop expansion. We explicitly give the expansion of the Gibbs potential up to two loops. We then apply our field-theoretic formalism to the case of a single impenetrable wall with counter ions only (in the absence of salt ions). We obtain the fluctuation corrections to the electrostatic potential and the counter-ion density to one-loop order without further approximations. The relative importance of fluctuation corrections is controlled by a single parameter, which is proportional to the cube of the counter-ion valency and to the surface charge density. The effective interactions and correlation functions between charged particles close to the charged wall are obtained on the one-loop level.},

    abstract = {{Available for the first time in paperback, R. Tyrrell Rockafellar's classic study presents readers with a coherent branch of nonlinear mathematical analysis that is especially suited to the study of optimization problems. Rockafellar's theory differs from classical analysis in that differentiability assumptions are replaced by convexity assumptions. The topics treated in this volume include: systems of inequalities, the minimum or maximum of a convex function over a convex set, Lagrange multipliers, minimax theorems and duality, as well as basic results about the structure of convex sets and the continuity and differentiability of convex functions and saddle- functions. This book has firmly established a new and vital area not only for pure mathematics but also for applications to economics and engineering. A sound knowledge of linear algebra and introductory real analysis should provide readers with sufficient background for this book. There is also a guide for the reader who may be using the book as an introduction, indicating which parts are essential and which may be skipped on a first reading. "This book should remain for some years as the standard reference for anyone interested in convex analysis." J. D. Pryce, Edinburgh Mathematical Society}},

abstract = { A mean-field approach to the electrostatics for solutes in electrolyte solution is revisited and rigorously justified. In this approach, an electrostatic free energy functional is constructed that depends solely on the local ionic concentrations. The unique set of such concentrations that minimize this free energy are given by the usual Boltzmann distributions through the electrostatic potential which is determined by the Poisson&#x2212;Boltzmann equation. This approach is then applied to the variational implicit solvent description of the solvation of molecules [Dzubiella, Swanson, McCammon, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006, 96, 087802; J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124, 084905]. Care is taken for the singularities of the potential generated by the solute point charges. The variation of the electrostatic free energy with respect to the location change of solute&#x2212;solvent interfaces, that is, dielectric boundaries, is derived. Such a variation gives rise to the normal component of the effective surface force per unit surface area that is shown to be attractive to the fixed point charges in the solutes. Two examples of applications are given to validate the analytical results. The first one is a one-dimensional model system resembling, for example, a charged solute or cavity in a one-dimensional channel. The second one, which is of its own interest, is the electrostatic free energy of a charged sphercal solute immersed in an ionic solution. An analytical formula is derived for the Debye&#x2212;H&#xfc;ckel approximation of the free energy, extending the classical Born's formula to one that includes ionic concentrations. Variations of the nonlinear Poisson&#x2212;Boltzmann free energy are also obtained. }

  abstract={The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is often presented via a variational formulation based on the electrostatic potential. However, the functional has the defect of being non-convex. It cannot be used as a local minimization principle while coupled to other dynamic degrees of freedom. We formulate a convex dual functional which is numerically equivalent at its minimum and which is more suited to local optimization.}

doi = {10.1073/pnas.0607746104}, 
abstract ={When a liquid mixture is subjected to external electric fields, ionic screening leads to field gradients. We point out that, if the mixture is initially in the homogeneous phase, this screening can bring about a robust phase-separation transition with two main features: (i) the phase separation is expected to occur in any electrode geometry, and (ii) the voltage required is typically of the order of 1 V and even less. We discuss several applications of the effect relevant to the field of microfluidics, focusing on the creation of a nanometer-scale lubrication layer in the phase separation process and the modification of the slip length.},

  abstract={We examine the force between two charged surfaces immersed in aqueous mixtures having a coexistence curve. For a homogeneous water-poor phase, as the distance between the surfaces is decreased, a water-rich phase condenses at a distance D t in the range 1–100 nm. At this distance the osmotic pressure can become negative leading to a long-range attraction between the surfaces. The osmotic pressure vanishes at a distance D e < D t , representing a very deep metastable or globally stable energetic state. We give analytical and numerical results for D t and D e on the Poisson-Boltzmann level.}
