<BR><B>Cellular structures are established and maintained through a dynamic
interplay between assembly phenomena and regulatory processes. From this
perspective, self-organization of molecular components provides a variety
of possible spatial structures; the regulatory machinery constantly chooses
the most appropriate to express a given cellular function</B>1<B>. Here,
we study the extent and the characteristics of such self-organization using
microtubules and molecular motors</B>2, 3<B> as a model system. These components
are known to participate in the formation of many cellular structures,
such as the dynamic asters found in mitotic and meiotic spindles</B>4,
5<B>. We show that simple multi-headed motor constructs, built with kinesin</B>6,
7<B>, together with stabilized microtubules are capable of forming asters.
Dynamic asters can be obtained starting from a homogeneous solution of
tubulin and motors. By varying the relative concentrations of the components,
we obtain a collection of self-organized structures. We study this process
in a constrained geometry of micro-fabricated glass chambers</B>8<B> and
demonstrate that the same steady-state structure can be reached through
different assembly ?pathways?.</B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Mitotic spindle formation is an intensively studied prototype of cell morphogenesis
phenomena. In the classical scenario1, a bipolar spindle forms when mitotic
chromosomes capture and selectively stabilize dynamic microtubules nucleated
by the two centrosomes. This assembly process can tolerate numerous variations
in intermediate configurations, including different chromosome positions
and geometrical and mechanical perturbations9. Spindles can also form in
the absence of centrosomes, as observed in meiotic cell divisions, and
more surprisingly in <I>in vitro</I> experiments in <I>Xenopus l&aelig;vis</I>
egg extracts devoid of centrosomes10, 11. In the latter case, microtubules
grown in the vicinity of chromatin are organized into a bipolar spindle
by molecular motors. Beyond their immediate impact on the study of mitosis,
these results are important for two reasons. Firstly, they suggest that
microtubules and motors alone are capable of self-organizing into quite
evolved spatial structures. Secondly, from a more general perspective,
they also demonstrate that formation of a cellular structure can take place
through various, distinct ?assembly pathways?10, 11. It is easy to imagine
that, as in the case of metabolic or signal transduction pathways, a given
route of assembly could be selected depending on cell type, interactions
with the environment or state of growth.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>In order to explore the issues of self-organization of microtubules and
motors, and of the existence of different assembly pathways, we have constructed
a radically simplified system with only a few purified components. In addition
to tubulin, this system includes artificial molecular constructs of several
kinesin heads associated through biotin-streptavidin links (see Material
and Methods).We have chosen kinesin because of it's extensive molecular
characterization12-14. The motor constructs, which we will often refer
to as ?kinesins? or ?motors?, are able to attach to neighboring microtubules
and then, in the presence of ATP, to move towards their ?plus? ends15.
In this way they form dynamic crosslinks between microtubules (Figure 1a).&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Figure 1b shows self-organization in a system of microtubules stabilized
with taxol16 and mixed with motors. The sample is sandwiched between slide
and coverslip in a quasi-two dimensional geometry. A starting configuration
is an isotropic ?gel? consisting of microtubules crosslinked randomly by
motors (not shown). Asters of microtubules form within a few minutes as
kinesins accumulate in their centers. (Similar asters were previously observed
to form in a system of kinesin-containing chromaffin vesicles mixed with
microtubules17; or in <I>Xenopus l&aelig;vis</I> egg extracts with the
addition of taxol18, or DMSO19.) Naturally, the size of asters is determined
by the length distribution of stabilized microtubules. When the separation
between two neighboring asters is small enough, so that there exists an
overlapping region containing microtubules and motors, the asters merge20.
The aster formation can be reproduced in numerical simulations (Figure
1c) in which microtubules are treated as flexible, polar rods and kinesin-like
motors are characterized by a linear force-velocity curve13, 14, a high
duty ratio biochemical cycle and a tendency to remain attached to microtubule
plus ends21, 22 (see Materials and Methods). The simulations demonstrate
that these properties are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed
behavior. It is important to note that stabilizing microtubules with taxol
is not necessary for aster formation: asters also form if microtubules
are allowed to assemble and disassemble through the dynamic instability23;
all experiments presented below are performed in this way.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>In order to study the influence of geometrical constraints on self-organization
in our model system, we have encapsulated solutions of tubulin and motors
in sealed micro-fabricated glass chambers8 of different shapes, with typical
lateral dimensions of 100 microns, and a thickness of 5 microns (Figure
2). In a cylindrical geometry, an initially homogeneous solution first
transforms into a symmetric aster centered in the chamber. As microtubules
grow further and begin to buckle, the center of the aster becomes unstable
and a vortex structure forms. Vortices can be simultaneously observed in
hundreds of chambers etched in a single coverslip and filled with the same
initial solution; both structures with right-handed and left-handed vorticity
are observed with equal probabilities. Since vortices form from asters,
the microtubules have their plus ends oriented towards the center of the
vortex. Therefore, small objects such as short microtubules or small colloidal
beads with motors attached to them, circle around the core of the vortex20.
This circulatory motion is reminiscent to the microtubule and motor dependent
movement of cytoplasm observed in the development of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>
oocytes24-26. Vortices can also be reproduced in numerical simulation by
incorporating geometrical confinement and the dynamic assembly of microtubules
(Figure 2b). This simulation exhibits an assembly pathway very similar
to the one observed in experiments, in which an initially symmetric aster
is destabilized by the growth and buckling of microtubules. The radius
of the vortex core is found to increase with the average length of microtubules.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>A natural question now emerges: is the assembly through a symmetric aster
the only possible route leading to the final vortex structure? To answer
it, we have enclosed the same solution of proteins in a chamber of the
same size but with the topology of a torus. We were inspired here by elegant
experiments of micro-surgery performed on melanophores27, in which the
geometry of the cell was artificially changed. Obviously, the formation
of symmetric asters is now prevented by the geometry of the chamber. Nevertheless,
the same final steady-state, a vortex, can be reached (Figure 2c). This
demonstrates that our simple model system can find alternative assembly
pathways.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Further experiments have shown that the precise shape of the containers
is often unimportant for the choice of final assembled structures. For
instance, we have regularly observed formation of circular vortices in
square chambers20, However, if the same solution of proteins is encapsulated
in the chamber of the same torus-like shape but of a larger lateral size,
a different final structure is observed (Figure 2d).&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>A surprising variety of larger-scale patterns can be formed in an unconfined
geometry by further self-organization of the previously described structural
elements, asters and vortices. The final patterns depend on the initial
concentrations of molecular components: a 2-fold variation in the concentration
of kinesin, included in the same solution of assembling microtubules, results
in distinctly different patterns (Figure 3). At low motor concentrations,
a lattice of vortices forms; at slightly higher kinesin concentrations,
one observes lattices of asters. As discussed above, overlapping asters
tend to fuse - this process determines the final distance between the asters.
For higher motor concentrations, the fusion process increases in efficiency
and the average size of the asters becomes larger. Finally, at even higher
motor concentrations, a distinct state is achieved in which the microtubules
form bundles; This process is sensitive to the microtubule nucleation rate.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Self-organization observed in the present experiments can be compared to
pattern formation encountered in simple physical systems28. A variety of
structures has been formed far from thermal equilibrium from a homogeneous
solutions of proteins and from a gel of fibers, connected through physical
(i.e. non-covalent) dynamic crosslinks. The energy dissipated in these
structures is injected into the system through ATP and GTP hydrolysis29,
30. From this point of view, the situation is reminiscent of patterns formed
in chemical reactions. The use of protein components, however, opens a
possibility of additional control on molecular level. From a physicist's
perspective a complete characterization of the phenomena described here
should include evaluation of all the relevant time and length scales, and
determination of the out-of-equilibrium phase diagrams.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>These simplified experiments show that the basic structural ?vocabulary?
used by the cell is extremely rich: with two basic components, and simple
local rules of interaction, one obtains a large variety of assembled structures.
By extending the present system so it includes other interacting components,
such as nucleation centers for microtubules or different motors, it should
be possible to explore the conditions and the components necessary and
sufficient for formation of various other structures. An even more interesting
direction of further study would consist of introducing some elements of
regulation. One could then search for rules underlying the choice of different
?words? from this large ?vocabulary? of self-organized structures.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B>Material and Methods.</B> <U>Proteins:</U> Recombinant kinesin K401-bio,
consisting of 401 amino-acids of the N-terminal motor domain of the heavy
chain of <I>D. melanogaster</I> kinesin linked to the BCCP sequence of
<I>E.coli </I>(gift from E. Young and J. Gelles), was expressed in <I>E.coli</I>
and purified31. These recombinant kinesins form biotinylated active dimers
31, 32, which can then be joint by adding streptavidin33 (Molecular Probes).
A solution of motor constructs was obtained by mixing streptavidin and
purified K401-bio, giving final concentrations of 22 &micro;g/ml and ~180
&micro;g/ml, respectively. Tubulin was purified8, the stock solution was
at ~15.3 mg/ml in M2B buffer (80mM Pipes+KOH to pH 6.8, 2mM MgCl2, 1mM
EGTA). <U>Assay with stabilized microtubules</U>: To polymerize microtubules,
a solution containing 1.25 mg/ml tubulin, 1mM GTP, 1% DMSO in M2B was kept
at 37&deg;C for 15 min., taxol was then added to a final concentration
of 20&micro;M. Polymerized microtubules were kept at room temperature.
To start self-assembly, polymerized microtubules, motor constructs, and
a ATP solution were mixed to give final concentrations of 0.27 mg/ml tubulin,
60&micro;g/ml K401-bio, 8 &micro;g/ml Streptavidin, 4mM ATP, 0.6 mM GTP,
7mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 1mM EGTA, 27 &micro;g/ml a-casein (Sigma), 0.3% DMSO,
20&micro;M taxol, 80mM PIPES/KOH to pH 6.8. This mixture was immediately
examined by microscopy. <U>Assay with non-stabilized, dynamic microtubules</U>:
A mixture of purified (unpolymerized) tubulin, motor constructs and a cocktail
of nucleotides was now used. Apart from an increased tubulin concentration
of 5.1 mg/ml and absence of taxol, all other concentrations were kept as
in the assay with stabilized microtubules, except if further specified.
Polymerization of microtubules was started by heating the sample to 37&deg;C
on the microscope. <U>Glass cleaning and coating</U>: VWR-brand 24x60 mm
N&deg;1 coverslips were cleaned by three rounds of sonication in a hot
solution (~80&deg;C) of 10% of VWR-Extran 1000 in deionized water, followed
by 5 rounds of sonication in pure, hot, deionized water. Slides were then
immersed in pure ethanol and air-dried. Glass cleaned this way was hydrophilic.
To prevent kinesin and microtubules from sticking to the surface, slides
had then to be coated. They were dipped into a solution of 0.1% agarose
in deionized water and were allowed to dry. This layer was further coated
by dipping the glass first into a solution of 0.2% bovine serum albumin
in M2B filtered at 0.2&micro;m and then 4 times into deionized water. Coated
slides were kept humid and were used within a few hours. <U>Fabrication
of microchambers</U>: as in 8. Glass with microfabricated chambers was
cleaned and coated as usual. Sealing of the microchambers was achieved
by applying a steady ~20kg/cm2 pressure for 3 minutes on the pit-containing
coverslip and the slide. <U>Microscopy and imaging</U>: a Zeiss Axiovert
135 TV with an Olympus 100X iris objective, an Olympus 20X objective<B><I>
</I></B>and a Zeiss dark-field ultra condenser was used. Both condenser
and objective were heated to warm immersion oil and the sample to 37&deg;C.
This was achieved by circulating warm water through cooper-tubing wrapped
around them. A Paultek CCD camera was used to record a S-VHS video, no
video processing was necessary to observe microtubules. A Nikon camera
was also mounted on the microscope to take slides with Kodak Ektachrome
P1600 film. <U>Simulations</U>: simulations will be described in detail
elsewhere 20. Essentially, we simulated 10 min. of natural time with a
time step of 10-4 sec. using molecular dynamic method at temperature zero.
Microtubules were represented by short rigid rods of 6 &micro;m connected
with flexible links; they could grow and shrink according to a simple model
of dynamic instability34 The simulations were two-dimensional; the excluded
volume interactions between microtubules were neglected so that microtubules
can cross one another. This corresponds to experiments performed in thin
chambers or between closely spaced glass surfaces. Motors formed force
generating links between two microtubules. The movement of the microtubules
was then calculated at each time-step by assuming a completely damped viscous
regime. At each time-step, motors moved along the microtubules with a speed
which is a function of the force they exert. Motors also were assumed to
stay attached with a higher probability at the ?plus? ends of microtubules21,
22. Unbound motors could bind with small probability when two microtubules
cross each others. Almost all of the relevant parameters are known from
previous experiments: microtubules dynamic instability parameters: polymerisation
speed 2 &micro;m/min.35, microtubule rigidity: persistence length 5 mm.36,
motor maximum force 5 pN and force-speed curve: linear with maximum speed
0.8 &micro;m/s 12, 13, microtubule viscous drag and diffusion coefficients:
calculated assuming microtubules are perfect cylinders moving in water37.
Only the probability of a motor to bind, and to unbind upon reaching a
microtubule end had thus to be estimated to 0.2 1/s.&nbsp;

<B>(b)</B> Formation of an aster as observed by dark-field microscopy:
polymerized and taxol-stabilized microtubules were mixed with motor constructs
and ATP. The sample is shown after ~1 min. (center) and ~2 min. (right).
The bright spot in the center of the aster is caused by light scattering
from accumulated microtubules and motors. Kinesin K401-bio moves microtubules
with typical speeds up to ~0.8 &micro;m/sec in motility assays (data not
shown). We have varied the relative amount of streptavidin to kinesin and
have found that the maximum activity in motility assays is observed at
a stochiometric ratio of 4 K401-bio dimers per streptavidin, this ratio
was used for all experiments. No aster is formed without streptavidin,
or with too much streptavidin (ratio larger than 10). Note that in the
cells and cell free extracts, where the asters are organized by minus-end
directed motors, such as dyneins18, 19, the asters polarity is opposite.
