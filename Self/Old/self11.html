<BR>
<BR><B>Cellular structures are established and maintained through a dynamic
interplay between assembly phenomena and regulatory processes. From this
perspective, self-organization of molecular components provides a variety
of possible spatial structures; the regulatory machinery constantly chooses
the most appropriate to express a given cellular functionc</B>1<B>. Here,
we study the extent and the characteristics of self-organization using
microtubules and molecular motors</B>2<B> as a model system. These components
are known to participate in the formation of many cellular structures,
such as the dynamic asters found in mitotic and meiotic spindles</B>3,
4<B>. We show that a simple system consisting solely of multi-headed motor
constructs, built with kinesin</B>5<B>, and stabilized microtubules is
capable of organizing into asters. Dynamic asters can also be obtained
starting from a homogeneous solution of tubulin and motors. By varying
the relative concentrations of the components, we obtain a collection of
self-organized structures. We study this process in a constrained geometry
of micro-fabricated glass chambers</B>6<B> and demonstrate that the same
final structure can be reached through different assembly pathways.</B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Mitotic spindle formation is an intensively studied prototype of cell morphogenesis
phenomena. In the classical scenario1, a bipolar spindle forms when mitotic
chromosomes capture and selectively stabilize dynamic microtubules nucleated
by two centrosomes. This assembly process can tolerate numerous variations
in intermediate configurations, including different chromosome positions
and geometrical and mechanical perturbations7. Spindles can also form in
the absence of centrosomes, as observed in meiotic cell divisions, and,
more surprisingly, in <I>in vitro</I> experiments in <I>Xenopus l&aelig;vis</I>
egg extracts devoid of centrosomes8, 9. In the latter case, microtubules
grown in the vicinity of chromatin are organized into a bipolar spindle
by molecular motors. Beyond their immediate impact on the study of mitosis,
these results are important for two reasons. Firstly, they suggest that
microtubules and motors alone are capable of self-organizing into quite
evolved spatial structures. Secondly, from a more general perspective,
they also demonstrate that formation of a cellular structure can take place
through various, distinct assembly pathways 8, 9. It is easy to imagine
that, as in the case of metabolic or signal transduction pathways, a given
route of assembly could be selected depending on cell type, interactions
with the environment or state of growth.
<BR>
<BR>In order to explore the issues of self-organization of microtubules and
motors, and of the existence of different assembly pathways, we have constructed
an extremly simplified system with only a few purified components. In addition
to tubulin, this system includes artificial molecular constructs of several
kinesin heads associated through biotin-streptavidin links (see Material
and Methods).We have chosen kinesin because of its extensive molecular
characterization10-12. The motor constructs, which we will often refer
to as  kinesins  or  motors , are able to attach to neighboring microtubules,
and then, in the presence of ATP, to move towards the microtubule  plus 
ends13. In this way they form dynamic crosslinks between microtubules (Figure
1a).
<BR>
<BR>Figure 1b shows self-organization in a system of microtubules stabilized
with taxol14 and mixed with motors. The sample is sandwiched between slide
and coverslip in a quasi-two dimensional geometry. The starting configuration
is an isotropic  gel  consisting of microtubules crosslinked randomly by
motors (not shown). Asters of microtubules form within a few minutes as
kinesins accumulate in their centers. (Similar asters were previously observed
to form in a system of kinesin-containing chromaffin vesicles mixed with
microtubules15; as well as in <I>Xenopus l&aelig;vis</I> egg extracts with
the addition of taxol16 or DMSO17.) Naturally, the size of asters is determined
by the length distribution of stabilized microtubules. When two neighbouring
asters overlap sufficiently, they can merge18. The aster formation can
be reproduced in numerical simulations (Figure 1c), in which microtubules
are treated as flexible, polar rods, and kinesin-like motors are characterized
by a linear force-velocity curve11, 12, high processivity11, 12 and a tendency
to remain attached to microtubule plus ends19 (see Materials and Methods).
The simulations demonstrate that these properties are sufficient to explain
the experimentally observed behaviour. The use of taxol permits a control
of microtubule's length and number, however, it is important to note that
stabilizing microtubules with taxol is not necessary for aster formation;
asters also form if microtubules are allowed to assemble and disassemble
through the dynamic instability20. All experiments presented below are
performed in the absence of taxol.
<BR>
<BR>In order to study the influence of geometrical constraints on self-organization,
we have encapsulated solutions of tubulin and motors in sealed micro-fabricated
glass chambers6 of various shapes, with typical lateral dimensions of 100
microns, and a thickness of 5 microns (Figure 2). In a cylindrical geometry,
an initially homogeneous solution first transforms into a symmetric aster
centered in the chamber. As microtubules grow further and begin to buckle,
the center of the aster becomes unstable and a vortex structure forms.
Vortices can be simultaneously observed in hundreds of chambers etched
in a single coverslip and filled with the same initial solution; we saw
in equal number structures with right-handed and left-handed vorticity.
Since vortices form from asters, the microtubules have their plus ends
oriented towards the center of the vortex; small objects such as short
microtubules or small colloidal beads with motors attached to them, circle
around the core of the vortex18. This circulatory motion is reminiscent
of the microtubule and motor dependent movement of cytoplasm observed in
the development of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> oocytes21. Vortices can
also be reproduced in numerical simulation by incorporating geometrical
confinement and the dynamic assembly of microtubules (Figure 2b). This
simulation exhibits an assembly pathway very similar to that in the experiments,
in which an initially symmetric aster is destabilized by the growth and
buckling of microtubules.
<BR>
<BR>A natural question now emerges: is the assembly through a symmetric aster
the only possible route leading to the final vortex structure  To answer
it, we have enclosed the same solution of proteins in a chamber of the
same size but with the topology of a torus. We have been inspired here
by experiments of micro-surgery performed on melanophores22, in which the
geometry of the cell was artificially changed. Obviously, the formation
of symmetric asters is now prevented by the geometry of the chamber. Nevertheless,
the same final steady-state, a vortex, can be reached (Figure 2c). This
demonstrates that this simple system can find alternative assembly pathways.
<BR>
<BR>Further experiments have shown that the precise shape of the containers
is often unimportant for the choice of final assembled structures. For
instance, we have regularly observed formation of circular vortices in
square chambers18, However, in a chamber of the same torus-like shape but
of a larger lateral size, a different final structure is observed (Figure
2d).
<BR>
<BR>A surprising variety of larger-scale patterns can be formed in an unconfined
geometry by further self-organization of the previously described structural
elements, asters and vortices. The final patterns depend on the initial
concentrations of molecular components: a 2-fold variation in the concentration
of kinesin, included in the same solution of assembling microtubules, results
in distinctly different patterns (Figure 3). At low motor concentrations,
a lattice of vortices forms; at slightly higher kinesin concentrations,
one observes lattices of asters. As discussed above, overlapping asters
tend to fuse - this process may determine the final distance between the
asters. For higher motor concentrations, the fusion process increases in
efficiency and the average dimensions of the asters becomes larger. Finally,
at even higher motor concentrations, a distinct state is achieved in which
the microtubules form bundles. This process is sensitive to the microtubule
nucleation rate, and depends on the salt conditions.
<BR>
<BR>Self-organization observed in the present experiments can be compared to
pattern formation encountered in simple physical systems23. Here a variety
of structures has been formed far from thermal equilibrium from a homogeneous
solution of proteins and from a gel of fibers, connected through non-covalent
dynamic crosslinks. The energy dissipated in these structures is injected
into the system through ATP and GTP hydrolysis24. From this point of view,
the situation is reminiscent of patterns formed in chemical reactions.
The use of protein components, however, opens a possibility of additional
control at the molecular level. From a physicist's perspective, a complete
characterization of the phenomena described here should include an evaluation
of all the relevant time and length scales, and the determination of the
out-of-equilibrium phase diagrams.
<BR>
<BR>These simplified experiments show that the basic structural  vocabulary 
used by the cell is extremely rich: with two basic components, and simple
local rules of interaction, one obtains a large variety of assembled structures.
By extending the present system as to include other interacting components,
such as nucleation centers for microtubules or different motors, it will
be possible to explore the conditions and the components needed for the
formation of other structures. Another direction of study would be to introduce
some elements of regulation. One could then search for rules underlying
the choice of different  words  from this large  vocabulary  of self-organized
structures.
<BR>
<BR><h3>Material and Methods.</h3> <U>Proteins:</U> Recombinant kinesin K401-bio,
consisting of 401 amino-acids of the N-terminal motor domain of the heavy
chain of <I>D. melanogaster</I> kinesin linked to the BCCP sequence of
<I>E.coli</I>, was expressed in <I>E.coli</I> and purified25. These recombinant
kinesins form biotinylated active dimers 25, which can then be joined by
adding streptavidin26 (Molecular Probes). A solution of motor constructs
was obtained by mixing streptavidin and purified K401-bio, giving final
concentrations of 50 &micro;g/ml and ~150 &micro;g/ml, respectively. Tubulin
was purified6, the stock solution was at ~15.3 mg/ml in M2B buffer (80mM
Pipes+KOH to pH 6.8, 2mM MgCl2, 1mM EGTA). <U>Assay with stabilized microtubules</U>:
To polymerize microtubules, a solution containing 1.25 mg/ml tubulin, 1mM
GTP, 1% DMSO in M2B was kept at 37&deg;C for 15 min., taxol was then added
to a final concentration of 20&micro;M. Polymerized microtubules were kept
at room temperature. To start self-assembly, polymerized microtubules,
motor constructs, and a ATP solution were mixed to give final concentrations
of 0.27 mg/ml tubulin, 50&micro;g/ml K401-bio, 17 &micro;g/ml Streptavidin,
1.4mM ATP, 0.6 mM GTP, 7.7mM MgCl2, 4.3 mM KCl, 1mM EGTA, 27 &micro;g/ml
a-casein (Sigma), 0.3% DMSO, 20&micro;M taxol, 80mM PIPES/KOH to pH 6.8.
This mixture was immediately examined by microscopy. <U>Assay with non-stabilized,
dynamic microtubules</U>: A mixture of purified (unpolymerized) tubulin,
motor constructs and nucleotides was now used. Apart from an increased
tubulin concentration of 5.1 mg/ml and absence of taxol, all other concentrations
were kept as in the assay with stabilized microtubules, except as further
specified. Polymerization of microtubules was started by heating the sample
to 37&deg;C on the microscope. <U>Glass cleaning and coating</U>: VWR-brand
24x60 mm N&deg;1 coverslips were cleaned by three rounds of sonication
in a hot solution (~80&deg;C) of 10% of detergent VWR-Extran 1000 in deionized
water, followed by 5 rounds of sonication in pure, hot, deionized water.
Slides were then immersed in pure ethanol and air-dried. Glass cleaned
this way was hydrophilic. To prevent kinesin and microtubules from sticking
to the surface, slides had then to be coated. They were dipped into a solution
of 0.1% agarose in deionized water and were allowed to dry. This layer
was further coated by dipping the glass first into a solution of 0.2% bovine
serum albumin in M2B filtered at 0.2&micro;m and then 4 times into deionized
water. Coated slides were kept humid and were used within a few hours.
<U>Fabrication of microchambers</U>: as in 6. Glass with microfabricated
chambers was cleaned and coated as usual. Sealing of the microchambers
was achieved by applying a steady ~20kg/cm2 pressure for 3 minutes on the
pit-containing coverslip and the slide. <U>Microscopy and imaging</U>:
a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV with an Olympus 100X iris objective, an Olympus
20X objective<B><I> </I></B>and a Zeiss dark-field ultra condenser was
used. Both condenser and objective were heated to warm the immersion oil
and the sample to 37&deg;C by circulating warm water through cooper-tubing
wrapped around them. A CCD camera (Paultek inc.) was used to record on
S-VHS video tape, no video processing was necessary to observe microtubules.
A Nikon camera was also mounted on the microscope to take slides with Kodak
Ektachrome P1600 film. <U>Simulations</U>: simulations will be described
in detail elsewhere 18. Essentially, microtubules were represented by short
rigid rods of 6 &micro;m connected with flexible links; they could grow
and shrink according to a simple model of dynamic instability27 The simulations
were two-dimensional; the excluded volume interactions between microtubules
were neglected so that microtubules can cross one another. This corresponds
well to experiments performed in thin chambers or between closely spaced
glass surfaces, in which microtubules are nearly parallel to the plane
of the sample. Motors formed force generating links between two microtubules.
The movement of the microtubules was then calculated at each time-step
by assuming a completely damped viscous regime. At each time-step, motors
moved along the microtubules with a speed which is a function of the force
they exert. Motors also were assumed to stay attached with a higher probability
at the  plus  ends of microtubules19. Unbound motors could bind with small
probability when two microtubules cross each others. Almost all of the
relevant parameters are known from previous experiments: microtubules dynamic
instability parameters: polymerisation speed 2 &micro;m/min. 28, microtubule
rigidity: persistence length 5 mm. 29, motor maximum force 5 pN and force-speed
curve: linear with maximum speed 0.8 &micro;m/s 10, 11, microtubule viscous
drag and diffusion coefficients: calculated assuming microtubules are perfect
cylinders moving in water30. Typical simulation covered 10 min. of real
time using standard molecular dynamic methods with a time step of 10-4s.
On a Silicon Graphic Indy (R4000) the simulation took ~3 hours.

polymerized and taxol-stabilized microtubules were mixed with motor constructs

The bright spot in the center of the aster is caused by light scattering
from accumulated microtubules and motors. Kinesin K401-bio moves microtubules
with typical speeds up to ~0.8 &micro;m/sec in motility assays (data not
shown). We have varied the relative amount of streptavidin to kinesin and
have found that the maximum activity in motility assays is observed at
a stochiometric ratio of 4 K401-bio dimers per streptavidin, this ratio
was used for all experiments. No aster is formed without streptavidin,
or with too much streptavidin. Note that in cells and cell free extracts,
where the asters are organized by minus-end directed motors, such as dyneins16,
17, the asters polarity is opposite. <B>(c)</B> Time sequence (0, 1.25
